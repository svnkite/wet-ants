Password Generator v1.0.0 

First, you might notice that I decided not to use prompts as requested in our challenge. I found them Ugly(tm)

And annoying...(tm)

So I decided to use modals instead to capture all needed information at once. 

Secondly, naming conventions for the variables as provided in the source code are vague and confusing, so you'll find that I switched those around a bit. 

Third, I did use some base code that I played around with to get the desired effect of the modals. I'll cite those at the end

Overall, I know modals are totally 90s but I felt like using them for our third week provided a more comprehensive refresher of the first weeks of the bootcamp so far, seeing as we have gone through the basics of HTML and CSS style sheets.
